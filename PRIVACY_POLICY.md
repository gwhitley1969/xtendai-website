## 1) Who we are

**Company:** Xtend-AI, LLC  
**Product:** My AI Bartender  
**Contact email:** support@xtend-ai.com

## 2) What we collect

### A. Information you provide

Depending on how you use the Services, you may provide:

- **Account and login info** (for example, email address or social sign-in): Authentication is handled by our identity provider. We do **not** store your password.
- **Age verification info**: You will be asked for information to confirm you are of legal drinking age (for example, date of birth).
- **Profile info**: Such as display name or a system-generated alias (if enabled).
- **User content**: Such as cocktail notes, custom recipes, favorites, bar inventory, and messages you choose to send through social sharing features (if enabled).

### B. Photos and camera data (Scan My Bar)

If you use Scan My Bar, you provide a **photo** (or camera capture) for ingredient/bottle identification.

- The photo is **processed to provide the feature**.
- We do **not** use your photos for advertising.
- Unless explicitly stated in the app at the time of capture, we do **not** retain bar photos after processing.

### C. Voice and audio data (Voice AI)

If you use Voice AI, your device captures audio and connects **directly** to our Voice AI provider using **WebRTC**. Our backend issues an **ephemeral session token** that allows this connection.

During a voice session:

- Your **audio** is processed to generate responses.
- **Speech-to-text transcription** may be generated (for example, to show you what you said and what the AI said).
- We store **voice usage and session metadata** such as session identifiers, duration (seconds used), and token counts to enforce quotas, prevent abuse, and operate the feature.

**Transcripts:** Depending on product settings and the version of the feature, transcripts may be:

- shown only in-app during the session and not stored long-term, or
- stored as conversation history associated with your account.

If transcripts are stored, they are used to provide and improve the Voice experience for you (for example, showing conversation history and debugging issues).

### D. Usage, diagnostics, and device information

We collect typical technical data needed to run and secure the Services:

- App interactions and feature usage (for example, quota usage, session duration)
- Log and diagnostics data (crash reports, performance metrics)
- Device and network information (device type, OS version, approximate location derived from IP, and similar signals)
- Identifiers used for security and fraud prevention

### E. Subscription and payment information

Purchases are processed by **Apple App Store** and/or **Google Play** (and/or our subscription management provider). We generally receive:

- Subscription status (active/inactive), product tier, renewal dates
- Transaction identifiers and receipt validation data  
  We **do not** receive or store your full payment card information.

---

## 3) How we use information

We use information to:

- Provide and operate the Services (including offline sync, features, and personalization)
- Authenticate users and prevent fraud/abuse
- Enforce tier limits/quotas and maintain service integrity
- Improve features, fix bugs, and monitor performance
- Provide support and respond to requests
- Comply with legal obligations

---

## 4) How we share information

We share information in limited ways:

### A. Service providers (processors)

We use service providers to operate the Services, including:

- **Cloud hosting, databases, and monitoring** (to run the app backend and telemetry)
- **Authentication/identity** (to let you sign in using email/password or social identity providers)
- **AI providers**:
  - Text chat and recommendations (Azure OpenAI)
  - Voice AI (Azure OpenAI Realtime; voice sessions connect from your device using WebRTC with an ephemeral token)
  - Scan My Bar image analysis (Anthropic Claude)
- **Subscriptions** (Apple App Store / Google Play and our subscription management provider, such as RevenueCat)

### B. Legal, safety, and enforcement

We may disclose information if we believe it’s required to:

- Comply with law, regulation, legal process, or government request
- Protect the rights, safety, and security of users, the public, or our Services
- Investigate and prevent abuse, fraud, or security incidents

### C. Business transfers

If we’re involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, or sale of assets, information may be transferred as part of that transaction.

---

## 5) Data retention

We keep information only as long as necessary to provide the Services, maintain security, enforce quotas, and comply with legal obligations.

Typical retention patterns:

- **Account data**: retained while your account is active.
- **Security/diagnostic logs**: retained for a limited period (often 30–180 days), unless we must keep them longer for legal or security reasons.
- **Voice usage/session metadata** (e.g., seconds used, session start/end, token counts): retained as needed for quotas, billing-related audits, and abuse prevention.
- **Voice transcripts**: may be retained if conversation history is enabled/implemented; otherwise they may be used transiently to display the conversation during the session.

---

## 6) Security

We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect information. No system is 100% secure; you use the Services at your own risk.

---

## 7) Your choices and rights

Depending on where you live, you may have rights to:

- Access, correct, or delete certain information
- Object to or restrict certain processing
- Request a copy of your data

You can request help at: **support@xtend-ai.com**.

## 8) Children’s privacy

The Services are **not intended for children**. You must be **of legal drinking age** to use alcohol-related features. If we learn we collected information from a child in violation of applicable law, we will delete it.

---

## 9) International users

We may process and store information in the **United States** and other countries where we or our providers operate. These locations may have different data protection laws than your region.

---

## 10) Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this policy. If changes are material, we will take reasonable steps to notify you (for example, in-app notice or on our website). The “Last updated” date reflects the latest version.
